**Controls**  
The controls are the same as the default VRTemplate in Unreal using the Oculus Touch Controllers, so if you are familiar with that, this should feel pretty natural. If not, there aren’t many controls to learn.

-*Teleport:* Pressing forward on the thumbstick on the right controller will make a path, which you will teleport to when you release the thumbstick

-*Rotation:* Pressing right or left on the left controller thumbstick will rotate the world around you.

-*Menu:* Pressing the menu button on the left controller will bring up the menu, which will be connected to the left controller's location. To select an option, point the right controller at the button and press the right trigger. The menu button you will select is the one that is highlighted gray.

-*Ping Chests:* Selecting this option in the menu will make all the chests on the map emit a bell sound. Use this to location the direction of the closest chest
-*Teleport to Spawn:* This button will teleport you to the starting area where you started the game.

-*Quit:* This button will quit the game 

-*Grabbing:* To grab objects such as 3D menu options and chests, press the grip button on whichever controller you are grabbing with. 

**Starting the game**  
	When you launch the game you will be put directly into the level in a starting area. Here you can get situated and get comfortable. There will be a 3D difficulty menu with 3 options, easy medium and hard. You must teleport over to it and grab the block of the difficulty you want. The gate will open and you will be able to go into the town. 

**Objective**  
	The objective of the game is to find all the treasure chests on the map. Depending on the difficulty you choose, there will be a different amount of chests you have to find in order to win. The chests spawn randomly around the map, so if you play again they will likely not be in the same spots.

**Playing the game**  
	When teleporting around the map, you might stumble upon the chests. The chests emit a humming sound, which you can use to pinpoint their locations. If you are still having trouble finding the chests, you can open the menu and select the Ping Chests option. This will make every chest on the map emit a bell sound, which should help you get a general idea of where the closest one is. From the menu you are also able to see how many chests you have collected out of the total number of chests. If you collect all the chests you will automatically be teleported to the win area, which is a tower outside of the normal play area. You will have another menu where you can choose to restart the game, or quit the game. To select the option you want, simply grab the block of the option you want. 
	If you happen to get stuck somewhere in the map, or simply would like to go back to the beginning of the map, in the menu in the Teleport to Spawn button which will teleport you to the starting area that you began the map at. This does not reset any progress, but simply moves you across the map.








HW1 README
- **Starting the Game**: Once you start playing in the editor, you start at the beginning of whatever level you were in inside the editor. Press “5” to start a new game, which will load the first level and reset your score and difficulty. To stop the game, you are able to press ”6”.
- **Playing the game**: You control the ball with WASD/ARROWS and the mouse. The mouse is able to rotate the camera around the ball and zoom in and out with the SCROLL WHEEL. The ball will move in the direction the camera is looking (W/UP is always towards where the camera is pointing). SPACEBAR is jump, which you can only do once, until you hit a surface again. Pressing “0” or LEFT MOUSE BUTTON will stop the ball’s rotation and lock it in place, if done while in air, the ball will slowly float downwards. On most levels, you are able to toggle “Hamster Mode” by pressing “H”. This will put the camera inside the ball, as if you are a hamster inside a ball. Pressing “J” will toggle “Top-Down Mode”. This will put the camera directly above the ball. This mode is forced on level_3, and will be automatically turned off when you reach level 4.
- **Objective**: The objective of the game is displayed at the beginning of each level, which is “Get to the exit”. The exit is located on the other side of the map and must be reached in order to progress to the next level. There are enemies that are present on certain levels that will hurt the player if they are touched. The enemy movement and damage is affected by the current difficulty. Collectable stars can be found on some levels. The amount you collect will be saved and displayed along with your score in between levels. If your health reaches 0 or you fall into the void present underneath the maps, you will have to restart the level, and a life will be deducted from your total. You start every new level with 3 lives. If your lives get to 0, the game is ended and you are presented with a screen where you can either restart the game from the beginning or exit the game, taking you back to the editor. On this screen you are also able to reset the high score, which will delete your current score and the high score. 
- **Difficulty**: There are 3 difficulties possible while playing(0,1,or 2). When starting a new game, the difficulty is set to 1. If you end a level with 3 lives remaining, the difficulty is raised. If you end a level with only 1 life remaining, the difficulty is lowered. If during the level, you are reduced to 1 life, the difficulty is lowered, making it easier to finish the level. 
- **Scoring**: When you reach the end of a level, the score gained is determined by the difficulty you finished it on. If you manage to get a higher score than the present high score, your score will replace the high score and transfer to future games.
